# branch-protection-app

## Setup  
Navigate to the project root and install the required dependencies: 
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
```
Once completed, start up the web service to begin listening for messages from the GitHub App: 
```sh
# Run the bot
npm start
```
Create a new repository in BrytBoyCorp (where the protector-app GitHub App is installed).  

Validate that a new branch protection rule has been added to the repository and that an issue describing the changes has been created as well.
